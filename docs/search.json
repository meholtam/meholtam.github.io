I completed two research projects- one focused on fish-feeding patterns and the other on microplastic deposition in sediment. You can find more details about these studies in the projects tab. I also conducted field work in Lamington National Park and Carnarvon Gorge, where I developed practical skills such as species identification, quadrat sampling, and transect surveys.\n\n\n\nPhysics, chemistry, biology, oceanography, statistics and data science,"
