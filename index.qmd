Welcome! Thank you for visiting my site.

I am a 3rd-year student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Environmental Studies to drive change through science and policy. I am the president of the Isla Vista Surfrider Foundation and am passionate about the intersection between ocean accessibility, conservation, and the surf industry.

On this site, you'll find more about my work, passions, and projects. Feel free to explore - and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or connect!
