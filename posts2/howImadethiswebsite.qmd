Thank you so much for visiting my website!!

I coded this website myself using Quarto and R-Studio. I learned these skills in my Statistics for Environmental Science class at UC Santa Barbara, ENVS193DS. Thank you to An Bui and Thuy-Tien Bui for their mentorship and support in building this website!
