While studying abroad at the University of Queensland, I had the opportunity to complete a research project while staying at the Moreton Bay Research Station on Minjerribah, North Stradbroke Island, Queensland.

The project studied the concentration of microplastics in sediment cores to determine whether the deposition in sediment has increased over time.

Please read the paper below to find out more.
