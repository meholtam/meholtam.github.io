I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to travel around the world and to surf in so many amazing places! As a surfer, the ocean is a second home to me, and this is one of the reasons I am so motivated to be an advocate for the ocean. Traveling and witnessing so much beautiful nature has left me even more empowered to protect it.
