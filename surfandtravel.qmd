I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to travel around the world and to surf in so many amazing places! As a surfer, the ocean is a second home to me, and this is one of the reasons I am so motivated to be an advocate for the ocean. Traveling and witnessing so much beautiful nature has left me even more empowered to protect it.

### Map of Everywhere I Have Surfed

##  Interactive Surf Map

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)
library(tidyverse)

# Load your surf data (make sure the CSV is in the "data/" folder)
surf_data <- read_csv("surfandtravel/surf_spots.csv") %>%
  rename_with(tolower) %>%  # makes column names lowercase
  rename(
    site = site,
    city = city,
    lat = lat,
    lon = lon,
    country = country,
    wave_type = `wave type`,
    notes = notes
  ) %>%
  filter(site != "Cardiff Reef")  # hides Cardiff Reef

# Build the map
surf_map <- leaflet(data = surf_data, options = leafletOptions(worldCopyJump = TRUE)) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldImagery, group = "Satellite View") %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap, group = "Street Map") %>%

  addMiniMap(toggleDisplay = TRUE, minimized = TRUE) %>%

  # Start with a global view
  setView(lng = 0, lat = 0, zoom = 2) %>%

  addMarkers(
    lng = ~lon,
    lat = ~lat,
    popup = ~paste0(
      "<b>", site, "</b><br>",
      city, ", ", country, "<br>",
      "Wave type: ", wave_type, "<br>",
      "<i>", notes, "</i>"
    ),
    group = "Surf Spots"
  ) %>%

  addLayersControl(
    baseGroups = c("Satellite View", "Street Map"),
    overlayGroups = c("Surf Spots")
  ) %>%

  addResetMapButton()

# Display the map
